Integrates the Claptastic clap! button into your blog giving people an easy way to applaud your content.

== Description ==

<p>The clap! button is a small button readers can click to tell you they liked what they saw. It's easy. There is no registering or typing in extra information. Just click it.</p>

<p>This is the less annoying way to get readers' feedback who would otherwise not have left a comment or let you know they stopped by and liked what you did. If your readers loved the content but didn't have anything to add in the comments, they can just clap it. Or maybe you don't have a comment section--this is a great way to get feedback without imposing on your readers.</p>

<p>What's more is you can go to the Claptastic website (http://claptastic.appspot.com/) and check out what everyone is clapping about right at that moment, as well as get the most clapped-about content in the past. This website is designed to simply highlight the best content and send readers your way.</p>

1. In the WordPress admin panel go to Plugins->Add New-> then search for 'claptastic' -> Install the Claptastic Clap Button

= Can you recite Pi to the 4th digit? =

I don't think so, no.

= What's your favorite movie? =

It's a toss-up between Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and Rocky I, although on most days the blaster beats the fist.
